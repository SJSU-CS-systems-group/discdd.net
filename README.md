# The Problem

Much of the world still doesn't have access to the internet.
Some parts never will due to economic conditions, lack of resources, and lack of local technical expertise.
Other parts lose internet access due to natural and man-made disasters.

# Our solution

Rather than transporting internet data over data channels, we physically transport the data using existing physical transportation methods, such as buses, trains, delivery vehicles, mules, etc.
We don't require any new infrastructure or equipment.
We use existing Android phones and USB keyfobs.
Our solution is completely software based and does not require new equipment or modifications to existing Android phones.
Users simply install our Android apps on their phones.
Our solution complements other solutions such as long-distance Wifi and satellite internet to bring internet services to the rest of the world.
